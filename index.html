            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Currently it is possible to control the planes around. To order
                a plane to do something, type its identifier followed by the
                plane's commands. Commands are a combination of one verb and an
                argument, followed by a separator (comma). If the command is
                invalid the plane will not perform the command. The verbs and
                their respective argument(s) are:
            <ul>
                <li><pre>a</pre> altitude, expects one number as parameter,
                    the target altitude in feet.</li>
                <li><pre>s</pre> speed, expects one number,
                    the target speed in knots.</li>
                <li><pre>c</pre> cleared to, expects one string,
                    the name of the navaid to which the aircraft is cleared
                    (direct, except if via is specified.)</li>
                <li><pre>v</pre> via, expects a string of waypoints in the
                    order they should be passed before the cleared waypoint,
                    separated by spaces.</li>
                <li><pre>h</pre> fly heading, expects one number, the heading
                    the aircraft shall fly.
            </ul>
            Each command should be followed by a ',' (comma).
            </p>
            <p> An example command is (as entered by the user):
            <pre>ASD123,a3000,s200,cARS,vKOGAV ELTOK&ltENTER&gt</pre>
            Read out, this command is:
            <pre>ASD123, altitude 3000, speed 200, cleared to ARS, via KOGAV ELTOK</pre>
            </p>

            <p>If you make a mistake while writing the commands you can use
            &ltBACKSPACE&gt as usual. &ltESC&gt clears the whole command.</p>
