            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Currently it is possible to control the planes around. To order
                a plane to do something, type its identifier followed by the
                plane's commands. Commands are a combination of one verb and an
                argument, followed by a separator (comma). If the command is
                invalid the plane will not perform the command. The verbs and
                their respective argument(s) are:
            <ul>
                <li><pre>a</pre> altitude, expects one number as parameter,
                    the target altitude in feet.</li>
                <li><pre>s</pre> speed, expects one number,
                    the target speed in knots.</li>
                <li><pre>c</pre> cleared to, expects one string,
                    the name of the navaid to which the aircraft is cleared
                    (direct, except if via is specified.)</li>
                <li><pre>v</pre> via, expects a string of waypoints in the
                    order they should be passed before the cleared waypoint,
                    separated by spaces.</li>
                <li><pre>h</pre> fly heading, expects one number, the heading
                    the aircraft shall fly.
                <li><pre>i</pre> cleared ILS approach, expects one string, the
                    name of the airport and the runway identifier.
            </ul>
            Each command should be followed by a ',' (comma).
            </p>
            <p> An example command is (as entered by the user):
            <pre>ASD123,a3000,s200,cARS,vKOGAV ELTOK&ltENTER&gt</pre>
            Read out, this command is:
            <pre>ASD123, altitude 3000, speed 200, cleared to ARS, via KOGAV ELTOK</pre>
            </p>

            <p>If you make a mistake while writing the commands you can use
            &ltBACKSPACE&gt as usual. &ltESC&gt clears the whole command.</p>
            <p>An example of an approach clearance is:
            <pre>ASD123,a3000,s140,h330,iESSA 26</pre>
            Read out this means:
            <pre>ASD123, altitude 3000, speed 140, heading 330, cleared ILS approach 26 at ESSA</pre>
            When the plane will fly on heading 330 until it intersects the
            outgoing 080 radial from the rwy 26 ILS. It will then turn
            towards the runway and descend as appropriate as it gets closer to the runway.
